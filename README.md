In this project, I create a fully-fledged document editor the likes of google docs.
I make use of modern technologies like: NextJs, Typescript, clerk for auth, liveblocks for multi-user collaboration
tiptap for the editor functionality., and convex for database.
This project gave me a hands on experience working with clerk, and convex, and also tiptap.
I am proud of how this project turned out.
