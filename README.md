This note is for the future me(James Muriuki Maina).

Hello sir,

If you are reading this, it means something worked out fine and now you are looking to steal some implementation from this project, which is okay.
I know that so many times I've not made you proud, but now that I've finnished this project, I want to tell you "I am so so Sorry", and I am on the way to make you proud.
Let me remind you that you are the best programmer I know and as far as you continue with the tenacity and vigour that I have right now, I promise you, every single goal, dream, and causality causation nonsense is gonna happen to your favour.

Trust in yourself \* (Number.isInfinity)

Maybe when you will be reviewing this code, you might be married and you want to shine to your wife how good of a programmer you were when you were in your second year in coding., ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚, that is an awesome move maybe you may get yourself laid thenðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚;
However, know that I love you and I will always be in by your side cheering for you... so you are never alone I am here with you.

Remember your why.

Your doppleganger at 21years;
